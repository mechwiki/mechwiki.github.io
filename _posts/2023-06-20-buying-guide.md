The most common question in this subreddit is “What keyboard should I buy?” Well, we’re here to help you answer that WITHOUT biased  responses.*

Okay cool. What do you need to know? If you're a beginner, you're probably used to using [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/Cm99qHY.jpg), or maybe [even this](https://i.imgur.com/DXJwdOk.jpg).

So whether you want [MORE GAMING POWER](https://i.imgur.com/ZjUrsAl.jpg), something [*a little more comfortable*](https://i.imgur.com/nKdvkma.jpg), or perhaps [some vintage feels](https://i.imgur.com/khEDYdd.jpg), I'm sure you'll be happy with at least your [increased efficiency](https://i.imgur.com/xmfOwb6.gif).

These are likely the things you care about most, and will be covered here:

- **Feels** - how the keyboard makes YOU feel. The sound, look, and tactility.
- **Features** - what different keyboards can *do*, and how many keys it takes to get the job done.
- **Cost** (With examples and buyer's guide)

## Basic terminology

Hang on, before we dive in, you'll need to know the terminology of the thing you're buying.

- Keyswitch: It's the mechanism that detects the presses, creates the  sound, and provides the feels. Keyboards are usually categorized by the  type of switch it has. For example, rubber dome keyboards use a membrane switch, while mechanical keyboards have... *mechanical* switches in them. You don't actually touch switches while typing. Your fingers are pushing on a plastic cover called a...
- Keycap: A piece of plastic stuck on top of each switch. It's what  you actually see and touch. Keycaps usually have letters on them to help you know what the switch underneath will trigger. Sometimes it can be  hard to tell where the cap ends and the switch begins, in which case we  use the term...
- Key! The term for a **key**switch and **key**cap put together. When you put a bunch of keys together in a case, you get a... 
- Keyboard! A bunch of switches held together by a case and covered by a set of keycaps.

## Feels

How a keyboard feels is arguably the most important thing when  choosing a board, and this is what most people have questions about, so  let's start here. There are many different kinds of keyboard switches.  All of them can be considered "mechanical" because  but they all feel  different, and some are embraced as "mechanical" more than others:

| Type of Switch   | General Feels                                                | Picture                                                      | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rubber Dome      | By far the most common type of standalone keyboard it  is cheap and easy to find.  Unfortunately has a lower lifetime and many  people think they feel like mashed potatoes after using a Mechanical  Keyboard.  See [/r/Keyboard](https://www.teddit.net/r/Keyboard) for more info. | [Rubber Dome Switch Picture](http://i.imgur.com/PCNqaWn.jpg) (ew) | [Logitech G19s](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g19s-lcd-gaming-keyboard) (actually pretty sweet, but I say no more.) |
|                  |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |
| Scissor Switch   | Usually rubber-dome based. Originally designed for laptops these have a short travel from 1mm in the Surface Pro 3 to [3.2mm in some Logitech Keyboards](http://blog.logitech.com/2009/12/15/different-strokes-for-different-folks/).  An advantage is there are many Tenkeyless and Full Size standalone  keyboards in wireless and backlit configurations.

| Buckling Spring  | Feels good man. Relatively high activation force (~75g). Nice *Click* upon activation, and *Clack* upon deactivation. A good metaphor is like wearing fat boots on a wood  floor. Like a cowboy. Clunky and crisp, in a good way. Please see [Ripster's Shoe Theory](http://imgur.com/a/DEB4L) for more shoe/switch metaphor. A user once said that every key on a buckling spring feels like the [launch button](http://i.imgur.com/zqzBLTQ.jpg) on a space ship! | [Buckling Spring Picture](http://i.imgur.com/MM6HIJ1.jpg)    | [IBM Model M](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IBM_Model_M.png#/media/File:IBM_Model_M.png) (doesn't look like much, but it's a legend) |

| ALPS             | There are all different sorts of ALPS, but most are  found on uncommon keyboards. There are a variety of feels associated  with these switches, similar to the variety of Cherry Switches. These  are less common, but there are more details in [Ripster's Switch Science Guide](http://www.teddit.net/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mlxuk/overview_of_33_switches/). | [ALPS Switch Picture](http://i.imgur.com/xAzig.jpg)          | [Dell AT102W](http://i.imgur.com/fdqCEnh.jpg)                |

| Topre            | Some say this is the most elegant feels. It's said to  feel smoother than Cherry, but far more solid than a standard rubber  dome. They're soft when bottomed out, and are not clicky. They're only  featured on a few, expensive keyboards. They use a combination of a  rubber dome and a spring for their mechanism, so it's said they adopt  the best of both worlds. | [Topre Switch Keychain Picture](http://i.imgur.com/oo6B72y.jpg) | [Realforce 104UG](http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=topre_keyboards,rf104&pid=yk2100) |

| Cherry MX        | FINALLY! These are the switches that most modern  mechanicals will have, the most commonly used. There are a large variety of switches, but in general, Cherrys are what you think of when you  think of mechanical switches. They are solid, have a good feel, and have a variety of options. These options and differences will be highlighted below. | [Cherry Switch Picture](http://i.imgur.com/0bp7m.jpg)        | [Ducky Shine 3](http://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Shine_3_DK9008.html) |

| Kailh            | Kailh switches, are knock offs of popular Cherry MXs.  They come in a variety of types (colors) which resemble original Cherry  types (Yellow being an exception) - Blue Kailh = Blue MX, Red Kailh =  Red MX etc. Kailh have also started to innovate around 2016 and  introduced new product lines called Speed, Box etc. Cost of keyboard  using these switches is their biggest advantage - prices start from $40.  Although rated higher than Cherry MX in MTBF at 60M the jury is still  out whether we will see defects like Switch Chaaatttteeerrrriiinnnng. | [Kailh switch picture](http://media.bestofmicro.com/4/V/444703/gallery/Kailh-Key_w_600.jpg). | [Fry's Gearhead](https://i.imgur.com/ZlEQf8g.jpg)            |

| Razer Switch     | Well, it is said that they're MX but made just for  gaming. Produced by a variety of Chinese companies, which is currently  believed to be TTC at the moment, they come in three types - orange,  yellow and green. Green is similar to MX Blues whereas orange is  something near Browns. Are these switches made for gaming? Yes. Are they worth? Not really, as several reviews show the difference (0.2mm,  within margin of error for Cherry MX) to be negligible, while some claim to notice less uniformity from switch to switch. | [Razer Switch picture](http://images.anandtech.com/doci/7911/RZBWU_14.JPG) | [Razer Blackwidow Ultimate](http://images.anandtech.com/doci/7911/RZBWU_11.JPG) |

### Cherry MX

http://i.imgur.com/wskQOwc.png

There are three kinds of switches that Cherry sells:

- A tactile switch has a “bump” when it is pressed. When you push a tactile switch, you push with the most force up until you reach the  actuation point of the switch (i.e., how hard you have to press the key  to register it), after which the switch will depress fully with very  little resistance. In theory, this lets the user know exactly when the  key has been actuated.  Note that the actuation point is never at the  bottom of the switch, meaning actuation will always happen before the  switch is fully pressed down.
- A clicky switch  is similar to a tactile switch, except it  produces some sort of sound when it activates. This kind of switch can  be annoying to some, due to the click being quite loud for fast typers  or gamers. Some prefer the “soft click” of the Cherry MX Whites, which  still offers a click but is less distinct.
- A linear switch doesn’t have a “bump”. Simply put, the deeper you press down a button, the harder it pushed back against your finger.  Think of it as pushing down a spring.

One thing to note is that tactile switches and clicky switches feel  almost completely different when pressed.  This is because the clicky  mechanism has a "snap-back" point (which is what creates the click  sound), while the tactile switches are more of a smooth bump. So, if you really like clicky switches, tactile switches might not cut it for you.

Cherry offers each kind of switch in varying degrees of stiffness  (i.e., how hard you have to press down before it activates.). This table below shows some of the variants.

#### The Table of Cherry MX Feels

|                            |      | Linear: No physical feedback     | Tactile: Quiet bump feedback | Clicky: Loud bump feedback |
| -------------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
|                            |      |                                  |                              |                            |
| **Medium**(45/50g)         |      | Red (45g)                        | Brown (small bump)           | Blue                       |
| **Slightly Stiff**(55-65g) |      | Nature White (55g) / Black (65g) | Clear                        | N/A                        |
| **Very Stiff**(80g)        |      | Dark Grey                        | Light Grey                   | Green and White            |

### ALPS Feels

Both complicated blue ALPS and Filco brown have a distinct sound and a two-part key feel. The Cherry Browns have a lower activation feel than an ALPS blue, and  are also a little quieter. Cherrys seem to have a lower impact than the  ALPS, but with a slightly softer landing upon bottoming out. ALPS will  feel crisper than rubber domes. They've been called more wobbly than  Cherry MX, and have very limited keycap availability.

The colors of ALPS keys are indicative of their tactility and  pressure, but they are too numerous for a table, and the colors are not  always consistent with their feels. For a more detailed guide, try [Ripster's Key Switch Science Guide](http://www.teddit.net/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mlxuk/overview_of_33_switches/)

### For SOUND samples see [here](http://www.teddit.net/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/keyboard_sound_samples)

## Features

------

While there are a wide variety of mechanical keyboards available,  some features will significantly limit your choice. Among the features  that will limit your selection are:

- Backlighting
- Integrated USB hub/audio ports
- Macro Keys
- Media Keys
- Wireless

In addition, if you’re interested in ever replacing all the keys of  your keyboard down the road for a custom look, some models are better  than others.

### Keyboard Size and Layout

For an in-depth understanding of **WHAT IS A 60/70-/75/90/100% Keyboard** see [The Tenkeyless Keyboard Wiki](http://www.teddit.net/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/tenkeyless_keyboards).

The sections below will give a general overview.

#### Size

The size of your keyboard will affect your ergonomics, how much space on your desk gets used, and the keyboard's functionality. Here is [a good image of the different layouts](http://i.imgur.com/ZbRSPld.png) of most consumer available keyboards.

- Standard (with numpad and arrow/navigation keys)
- Tenkeyless (no numpad, but with arrow/navigation keys)
- Compact (no numpad or arrow/navigation keys)

Some keyboards are available in either standard or tenkeyless versions.

You can also get "75%" keyboards, which fall in between 60% and TKL boards, which look like [this](http://deskthority.net/wiki/75%).

#### Layout

The most common layouts are [ANSI](http://i.imgur.com/r1oPJ2r.png) and [ISO](http://i.imgur.com/xhNQEUa.png). Most Americans, Canadians, and some parts of Europe use ANSI, while  other parts of Europe use ISO. Which one you get will usually depend on  your country and the language you will use.

Another subtle difference in layouts is key size. While a keyboard  might follow ANSI or ISO rules, some keyboard manufacturers make their  own rules. A common difference in keyboard key sizes can be seen here: http://imgur.com/a/pFn0J#0.

See the difference?

A normal key has a width of 1x, or about the size of a letter key.
 The most common sizes for the CTRL/ALT/WINDOWS (also known as modifier)  keys is 1.25x/1.25x/1.25x respectively. If you plan to buy keycaps for  your keyboard, this is the most universal. Some other keyboards have  1.5x/1x/1.5x. This layout is more difficult to buy keysets for.

### Backlight

This is all user preference. When using your computer in the dark,  it's nice to be able to see your keyboard. If you're a touch-typist,  meaning you don't look at the keys when typing, then this feature might  be much less important to you.

Some keyboards have programmable lighting, meaning you can control  which lights are on at what time, or have flashy lighting modes. These  are typically more expensive.

## Cost

------

How much are you willing to spend on your keyboard? In general,  unless you’re willing to dig for used keyboards on eBay/local thrift  stores, you will need to spend at least $70 for a good mechanical  keyboard with Cherry MX switches. Most mid-range keyboards are in the  $100-150 range. Anything over that can be considered expensive.

**Okay, so how much do you want to spend?**

#### I'm a starving student living in my parents' basement. I have no money, but I want the feels.

Here are some keyboards in the $0-100 range (in Alphabetical Order):

If you can’t afford a new keyboard, you might try going used - and  there’s really one keyboard that is bulletproof, no matter how old it  is. The king of keyboards, the Model F, will last a lifetime. Weighing  in at about 6lbs (almost 3kg), this is a solid buy, and a historic and  vintage feel that must be used to be appreciated. Typically, the Model F is praised for its loud clicks/clacks, its heavy touch, and its strong  feedback. Great for typing, okay for gaming, and very loud. Great places to check are on Ebay or on [/r/mechmarket](https://www.teddit.net/r/mechmarket). Less common models can be hard to find though. |

The brand is owned by PFU  (Fujitsu subsidiary). Several generations and variants of the HHKB have  been made since the 1990s, each made by a different manufacturer:  original HHKB from Fujitsu, HHKB Lite from Chicony and HHKB Pro from  Topre. All of them use rubber domes, but only HHKB Pro comes with  electrocapacitive actuation technology. Unlike Topre Realforce, HHKB Pro does not have a metal backplate, which makes it very light and unique  sounding. The Pro 2 was offered in regular, silent, and bluetooth  models. The current Pro Classic is essentially a Pro 2 with a USB-C  port, while the new Hybrid models also offer bluetooth and key remapping software. |

#### My wrists hurt (RSI)

Seek medical help. An ergonomic keyboard may help, though.

[RSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) is no joke. Some of us came to the Keeb Life because it was a way to  get out of the pain of typing for years and years, yet our work revolves around it.

It is [established](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23157799_The_Split_Keyboard_An_Ergonomics_Success_Story) that a split keyboard may help with maintaining a neutral wrist  posture, while typing. Unfortunately, such design has never become a  widespread standard, thus ergonomic keyboards tend to be on the more  expensive side. They are [niche products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale) and often very complex from engineering perspective. Consequently, prices range from $150 to $500+ depending on model.

The most popular ergonomic keyboards are [Microsoft Natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Natural_Keyboard)/Sculpt product line and clones; those are *de facto* standard keyboards, except with a small gap in the middle and contoured ("tented") surface. As of 2020, there is only one very similar keyboard that features mechanical-contact switches: Cloud Nine C989M. However,  there are multiple more compact options with 60% to 75% layouts.

Another group of ergonomic keyboards uses a completely different key arrangement—symmetrical, often with staggered *columns* instead of rows—thus requires relearning to type (it takes several days to weeks to become fluent). The benefit is much more natural finger  posture. Decide for yourself, if you're okay with a steeper learning  curve.

The table below lists some of the most common or established options; models with a standard layout are higher in the list and ordered by  price. It is not exhaustive, though.

If you are interested in more resources, many less common ergonomic keyboards are listed in [Geekhack Ergonomics forum](https://geekhack.org/index.php?board=125.0), [Xah Lee's website](http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergonomic_keyboards_index.html), [awesome-split-keyboards at GitHub](https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards/blob/master/README.md) or [its fork](https://aposymbiont.github.io/split-keyboards/). There is an useful [layout-comparison overlay tool](https://jhelvy.shinyapps.io/splitkbcompare/).
