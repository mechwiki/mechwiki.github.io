# c/mechanicalkeyboards Wiki

Basically I'm just trying to migrate the r/mk wiki over here.

I'd like to get a good team of people together to keep this thing updated. Currently it's just a copy pasta with all the reddit links redirecting to Teddit.net instead. 
Hopefully we can get a good group of people together. PRs and whatnot are always welcome.

Thanks guys!
